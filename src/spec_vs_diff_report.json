A luxury shoe showcase website has been created with a prominent logo, clean elegant design, responsive shoe gallery, and clear contact methods (phone and WhatsApp). The sophisticated visual theme uses OKLCH color system with gold accents, serif typography (Playfair Display), and ample whitespace. All requested shoe images and logo are properly integrated. No pricing, shopping cart, or e-commerce features were added, adhering to the constraints.",
